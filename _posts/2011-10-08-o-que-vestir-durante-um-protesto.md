> Why are you protesting? “I’m  here just to see what everybody else is doing. I don’t know if I agree with all of this. All these kids are trying to protest against corporations while they’re wearing Hollister and J. Crew and smoking cigarettes, which are the hugest corporations in America.”

> “My shirt says 'Bail Out Workers Not Wall Street.' It’s actually a few years old, but I’m wearing it because Wall Street received trillions in bailout, while people are over their heads in debt and having a tough time paying bills. But I always dress like this. My shoes are Adidas. I got them for $20.”

> “We’re a band called Environmental Encroachment.   The leggings, I like to provide some hallucinogenic visual stimulation for people. Pretty much everything I’m wearing is supposed to be awe-inspiring and hallucinogenic. And it also feels really good to wear tights. ”

[Jornalistas do New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2011/10/06/fashion/20111006PROTEST.html) circularam pelas manifestações do [Ocuppy Wall Street](http://occupywallst.org/) perguntando o que as pessoas estavam vestindo e porquê. Interessante exemplo de como funciona a mecânica da mente discursiva, compondo cenários, criando amigos, inimigos e histórias.
