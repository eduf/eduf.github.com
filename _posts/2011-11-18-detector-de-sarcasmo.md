> It turns out scientists can program a computer to recognize sarcasm. Last year, Hebrew University computer scientists in Jerusalem developed their “Semi-supervised Algorithm for Sarcasm Identification.” The program was able to catch 77 percent of the sarcastic statements in Amazon purchaser comments like “Great for insomniacs” in a book review. The scientists say that a computer that could recognize sarcasm could do a better job of summarizing user opinions in product reviews.

No Smithsonian.com, [Richard Chin fala sobre a importância cultural, econômica e até biológica do sarcasmo](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/The-Science-of-Sarcasm-Yeah-Right.html?c=y&story=fullstory). Ah, o jornalismo sobre ciência.

Tenho a impressão de que, no século 21, o sarcasmo anda meio super-valorizado. Mas, enfim. Já estão inventando aplicativos para detectar a coisa.
