> When I started my career as a designer I was terrified that people would find out how much I didn’t know. Then I realized everyone else was terrified of the same thing. So I muddled and plowed my way through years and years of mistakes, all the while tucking the lessons away for later so I wouldn’t forget.

[Querido estudante de design](http://muledesign.com/2012/09/introducing-dear-design-student/) é o novo blog de [Mike Monteiro](http://muledesign.com/about/mike-monteiro/), autor de [Design Is a Job](http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job) e do vídeo [F*ck you, Pay Me](http://vimeo.com/22053820). Mas... sabe o que eu realmente gostaria de ter lido no começo da minha carreira, especialmente a de freelancer? [Esse artigo](http://jessicahische.is/thinkingthoughts/aboutpricing/), sobre a arte de cobrar pelo trabalho.
