> "What we discovered is that the imperfections in the eye—things like astigmatism and chromatic aberration—actually help it to focus," Geisler explains. That may help explain why people who have had their astigmatism corrected through laser eye surgery often have trouble focusing for several weeks afterward, Geisler says. That sort of understanding may have an impact on medical decisions, Thibos says. "People might be tempted to try and perfect nature," he says, "when maybe it's better to be a little bit imperfect."

Os pesquisadores norte-americanos Wilson Geisler e Johannes Burge [estudam como o cérebro humano faz para focar objetos](http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/10/deciphering-the-brains-autofocus.html). No processo, descobrem a importância das "imperfeições".
