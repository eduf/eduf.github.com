> The key to microproductivity is to eliminate the goal-setting, task-list mentality that we typically employ to keep on top of our workload. Microproductivity instead holds that getting anything done is better than getting nothing done. Don't plan to finish a major task in an unrealistic time-frame - the point of the practice is to squeeze productivity out of whatever time you have.
