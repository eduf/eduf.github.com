![William Gibson](http://caosordenado.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/gibson.jpg)Boa [entrevista de William Gibson no Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2011/10/14/william-gibson-interview.html). O autor de [Neuromancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) fala sobre a impermanência das nossas visões de futuro...

> There was an effort in the seventies to lose the usage science fiction and champion speculative fiction. Of course, all fiction is speculative, and all history, too—endlessly subject to revision. Particularly given all of the emerging technology today, in a hundred years the long span of human history will look fabulously different from the version we have now. If things go on the way they’re going, and technology keeps emerging, we’ll eventually have a near-total sorting of humanity’s attic.

...E de passado:

> In my lifetime I’ve been able to watch completely different narratives of history emerge. The history now of what World War II was about and how it actually took place is radically different from the history I was taught in elementary school. If you read the Victorians writing about themselves, they’re describing something that never existed. The Victorians didn’t think of themselves as sexually repressed, and they didn’t think of themselves as racist. They didn’t think of themselves as colonialists. They thought of themselves as the crown of creation.

Of course, we might be Victorians, too.
