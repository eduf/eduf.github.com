It's funny how sooner or later life organizes entropy.

Think about how many of us are dealing with social networks: we don't have time or patience to update all services that we are subscribed to. So we use cross posting services: if I blog here, an engine reads the post there, convert to a specific format, kicks the ball to another script and, suddenly, all the ground is covered.

Behind the scenes, there are many proprietary APIs working together to distribute all our content. When we sign to this kind of service, usually we are informed that things may change. And we click on the _agree button_. After a while, surprise, things do change. As happened to Twitter recently. Maybe you are following the [announcements](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/twitter-certified-products) and [opinions](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/91) about that.

It seems that we are watching another spontaneous movement to organize entropy. I mean: when Twitter strengthen its doors, it breaks the chain of machines which publishes our content. It force us to focus.

When the company tries to control its user's experiences, many of us stop and think: "do I _really_ need Twitter? Am I interested in deal with the interface that Twitter wants me to use? Do I need more ads?"

Then you check your followers. High numbers. But how many of them actually click at your content? Maybe they are the same people who subscribed to your blog. You already had a relationship with them.

So you realize: Twitter slowly became noise in your system. You don't really like the service that much. The people who care about your content had found and followed you not exactly because of Twitter.

Many of us take the leap and leave Twitter or gradually abandon the service. Consequentially, all those meta posting services gets somehow strange. Do I really need [Branch](http://branch.com) or even [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/global/) if I have comments on my blog? Are those tools helping me, as "a brand" and as a person?

At that point you listen the sparkling sound of the entropy getting tamed for a while. You have that sweet feeling of relief (or freedom) in not having to post, cross-post, pre-post, post-post, share or manage your content. And, when you have that old fire to write, you publish something at your own self hosted... blog.
