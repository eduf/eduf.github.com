> I read [this book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Know-It-All:_One_Man's_Humble_Quest_to_Become_the_Smartest_Person_in_the_World) once about this guy, A.J. Jacobs, who read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica and wrote about the experience. He said he had the problem where someone would be like, "Pass the salt," and he'd be like, "Oh, did you know that salt was originally used in medicine for this kind of thing, and then we learned it causes this?" And people would be like, "Just pass the salt."

Randall Munroe, criador do [xkcd](http://xkcd.com) — e, agora, do [What if](http://what-if.xkcd.com) —, em [entrevista ao The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/a-conversation-with-randall-munroe-the-creator-of-xkcd/262851/#). Que geek não passou por isso alguma vez?
