> The general state of technology is to be broken; which is not so different from other complex systems, like technology's users. (...) Human beings who can soldier on and stay happy and functional in the face of adversity are said to be "resilient," which means that they _fail well_.

It's good to pay attention to how fast our jets go, and how comfortable the upholstery is, but the thing we really need to keep our eyes on is what happens when they crack up, when their navigation systems go awry, and when they get a bad upgrade.
