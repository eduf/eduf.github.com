John Brownlee, from Cult of Mac, explains [why he stopped pirating music](http://www.cultofmac.com/188297/why-i-stopped-pirating-music/). More interesting is how he stopped collecting files and began to actually listen to music:

> (…) like many pirates, I downloaded far more albums out of convenience than I actually listened to. The albums I did listen to, I half-listened to, allowing the music to fill the background of my consciousness while I focussed on other things: reading a book, writing, playing a video game. I came to the majority of the music I downloaded as the worst kind of listener, a non-participant. I was amassing a collection, but collecting is not the same as appreciating.
> (…)

>  Recently, I bit the bullet and put myself together a proper stereo, very similar to the one my father had when I was younger. (…) What’s interesting to me about my stereo is how it’s facilitated the final step in my evolution in the way I experience music. Apple has always known that good tech changes the way you interact with a medium, and that’s just what my stereo has done, far more profoundly changing the way I listen to music than any iPod ever did. Part of it’s because my stereo sounds so great that listening to music on my Mac or my iPhone is a far shallower experience, but another big part of it is that my stereo isn’t something I can simply carry around with me: it’s 150 pounds of gear located in my living room, and to experience it, I must go to it and sit in front of it as an active participant. It’s an altar, of sorts, in front of which I feel and experience music.

In my case, I pretty much stopped downloading music because, actually, I still like to listen to the same 30 or 40 records I've been listening to for more than 20 years.

I can't help it.

I'm always trying something new. It's also really exciting rediscovering old sounds and musical styles —and if you're used to visit this crazy blog, you know that. But nothing makes me happier than those same old records. It doesn't matter the device I use.

You can call that obtuseness. The fact is: those records make me stop and pay attention. They're haunting me for many years. They're somehow imprinted in my memory. I have to listen to them again and again. And it's always a pleasure to do that. So why bother?
