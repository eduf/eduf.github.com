> To you and me, the star of the show is usually the singer onstage, but the most important person at a rock show is really the sound engineer who mixes the live audio. As former house big-concert mixing engineer Jon Graves tells me, the mixing engineer makes very good money, gets some star treatment on tour, often has a bit of an ego, and tends to bark orders to the other engineers and techs around him.

[Atesto e dou fe.](http://www.techhive.com/article/2000192/how-rock-concerts-work.html) Nao era a [Rollins Band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollins_Band) que tinha um engenheiro de som como integrante da propria banda (Theo Van Rock)? Ou era o Grateful Dead? Ou ambos?
