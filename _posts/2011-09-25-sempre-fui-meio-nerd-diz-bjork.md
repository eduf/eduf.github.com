> Biophilia, her most experimental project to date, looks set to divide opinion yet further. Its name - inspired by neurologist Oliver Sacks's book Musicophilia - evokes humankind's empathy with nature, which Björk has borne out with songs about genetics, crystallisation, plate tectonics and dark matter. The accompanying apps will be released in place of music videos, while the live shows have so far included a recorded voice-over by British naturalist David Attenborough, a live Tesla coil and four "gravity harps" suspended on 3-metre pendulums.
