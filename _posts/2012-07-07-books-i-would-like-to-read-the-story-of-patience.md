Suggestion for a PhD thesis: **The Story of Patience** (the most useful tool ever created). How did that word first appears in the West’s imaginary and literature? Main authors who thought about that concept. How it has changed throughout history. Philosophies who have thought about patience, cultural icons, inside and outside of religious boundaries. And, if the writer really has time and skills, he can also mention some Asian authors. I would buy a book like that. Wouldn’t you?
