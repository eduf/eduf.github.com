> That is to say: computers are not good readers (and even worse writers). Advancements are always being made, but as of now it’s necessary to break a text down into a bag of words so a clustering or classifying algorithm can process it.  And I can’t deny that there is something pleasantly surprising about the fact that the simplification of a text into a vector can be incredibly useful.  My literature student’s inclination is to resist anything but a holistic approach when analysing a text, but it’s always startling to see how the hyper-specialized nature of an algorithm can produce fascinating results.

Every time I read an article on [how computers process content](http://blog.scripted.com/dev/a-text-is-a-text-is-a-text/), I can't help remembering [memetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics).

Are memes finding a better way to reproduce themselves? I mean: instead of just using humans, they got to algorithms--which we are crafting to them.

At this point, computers are getting smarter and sharper on content curation. And, as we are spending more and more time digging content through social networks, we are creating terabytes of data per second to be processed and served latter for us and for machines.

Therefore, there are lots of new and different meme machines working together nowadays.

So many ideas are spreading out, that, in order to process them, we have developed the need to break them into its cores: letters, numbers, codes, relations between concepts.

Few years ago, that kind of job was left to philosophers and scientists. Now, even a person publishing a simple image of a cat can tag that picture. Meta data finally got mainstream. We are thinking more like computers so that computers can think more like humans.

Why? To produce content. To create more words. To reproduce memes. To speed our lives even more.

Maybe in the future we are going to need more cores, like computers are doing now. This is the result of the Modernism which we cherish so much.
