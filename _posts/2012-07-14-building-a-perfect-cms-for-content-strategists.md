[Content Strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_strategy) can be a heck of a boring subject (all those processes and taxonomies...). But, if you're trying to build a [CMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) or have to deal with one every day, you may want to listen [this episode](http://5by5.tv/contenttalks/10) of [Content Talks Podcast](http://5by5.tv/contenttalks/). [Karen McGrane](http://karenmcgrane.com/) and [Kristina Halvorson](https://twitter.com/halvorson) talk about how a good and well designed CMS would be. All episodes of the show are useful as well.
