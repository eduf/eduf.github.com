> "I'm a friend of Coca-Cola on Facebook", [Marc Benioff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Benioff) started out, standing two feet away from the machine, "and I come up to this Coca-Cola machine which was probably created before Facebook. How am I going to connect to this machine?"

> His hand was within striking distance of the dollar slot, but rather than engage in some impersonal exchange, he reached for his iPhone. "I just put my iPhone in front of the Coke machine, my iPhone knows where it is, it's got geolocation! It just gave me a point for being in front of this Coke machine, a loyalty point! It knows it's got these six products. If I choose 'collateral' for any of these six products at this time, I get another loyalty point. I'm connected to Coca-Cola."

Estou ansioso para virar amigo de marcas.
