> I think everyone should learn how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think. I view computer science as a liberal art, something everyone should learn to do.

Steve Jobs, in the famous [Lost Interview](http://www.caosordenado.com/books-i-would-like-to-read-the-story-of-patience/).

Well, at least, coding teaches you how language shapes thinking. Take an example: can you really be an atheist if you speak a language shaped by theistic concepts - which got so imprinted in the culture that we almost can't perceive that? (More about that on Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche's [teachings on tantra](http://www.chronicleproject.com/CTRlibrary/Journey-without-goal/talk4.html).)
