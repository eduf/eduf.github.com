> The ending James Murphy eventually conceived (to the LCD Soundsystem) could hardly have been more controlled: the band would play one final concert at Madison Square Garden, on April 2nd 2011, and it would be the biggest show of its brief existence. It sold out in 15 seconds. “Shut Up and Play the Hits” chronicles the last two days of LCD Soundsystem, starting a few hours before the concert and ending with Mr Murphy contemplating his fate, alone, the morning after.

> Bowing out this way has two advantages: Mr Murphy gets to secure his own legacy while also playing the biggest show of his career, the kind of show LCD Soundsystem could have been chasing for decades. There was no slow withering of talent. Nor, we are promised, will there be a cheesy reunion.
