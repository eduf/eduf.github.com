> There's one kind of simplicity that I like to call **simplexity**. When you take something incredibly complex and try to wrap it in something simpler, you often just shroud the complexity. You don't actually design a truly simple system. And in some ways you make it even more complex, because now the user has to understand what was omitted that they might sometimes need. That's simplexity.

Programadores quase sempre inventam [conceitos interessantes](http://www.artima.com/intv/simplexity.html). Eu usaria a ideia de outro jeito: toda vez que exageramos na tentativa de ser simples, criamos simplexidade.
