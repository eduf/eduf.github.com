> The Metamovement is a movement of movements. Not all these movements are similar; no two are exactly like; each can be readily distinguished from the next. The Arab Spring is part of the Metamovement; the London Riots were part of the Metamovement; protests spreading across America, under the banner of Occupy Wall St, are all part of the Metamovement.

> Yet, just like in an epidemic, each outbreak triggers the next--and in that cascade can perhaps be traced the jagged outline of the shared DNA within each cell of the larger metamovement.

> In other words, it's not just about inequality--but the deeper failure of institutions. To let people--especially the young--redress inequality by whatever slender means they might muster, by creating new opportunities. At every turn, the people in the Metamovement feel not merely spurned and scorned--but suffocated and strangled by institutions every bit as unflinchingly lethal as a hangman's noose.

Protestos se espalham em diversas partes do mundo. Nenhum deles parece articulado ao outro. Nem mesmo a algum tipo de teoria. [Mas talvez eles tenham algo em comum](http://umairhaque.blogspot.com/2011/10/metamovement.html).
