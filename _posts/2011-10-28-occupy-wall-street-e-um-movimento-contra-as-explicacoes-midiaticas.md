Cada um vê o que quer no movimento Occupy Wall Street. Talvez essa seja a sua beleza. Na Slate, Dahlia Lithwick [enxerga um movimento contra a mídia corporativa](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/how_ows_confuses_and_ignores_fox_news_and_the_pundit_class_.html). Quer dizer: os que protestam não querem se explicar. Pelo menos não do jeito tradicional, que caberia na televisão e nos jornais. Achei essa interpretação com um gosto de [](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maio_de_1968)Maio de 68. Mas sei lá.

> What the movement clearly doesn’t want is to have to explain itself through corporate television. To which I answer, Hallelujah. You can’t talk down to a movement that won’t talk back to you. (...)

Occupy Wall Street is not a movement without a message. It’s a movement that has wisely shunned the one-note, pre-chewed, simple-minded messaging required for cable television as it now exists. It’s a movement that feels no need to explain anything to the powers that be, although it is deftly changing the way we explain ourselves to one another.

Think, for just a moment, about the irony. We are the most media-saturated 24-hour-cable-soaked culture in the world, and yet around the country, on Facebook and at protests, people are holding up cardboard signs, the way protesters in ancient Sumeria might have done when demonstrating against a rise in the price of figs. And why is that? Because they very wisely don’t trust television cameras and microphones to get it right anymore. Because a media constructed around the illusion of false equivalencies, screaming pundits, and manufactured crises fails to capture who we are and what we value.
