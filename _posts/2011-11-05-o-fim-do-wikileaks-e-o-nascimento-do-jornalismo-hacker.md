> Just as the current wave of American start-up companies is fueled by programmers-turned-businessmen, **the next wave of journalism needs to be fueled by programmers-turned-journalists**. In fact, the very definition of a journalist may change from 'somebody who reports for a newspaper' to 'somebody who can acquire, publish and analyze important source documents.' Technology is the cornerstone of scientific journalism, as cheap storage and bandwidth is required to publish the massive amounts of data, and the kind of data which doesn't translate to a newspaper page.

Old media has been extremely bad at realizing this. Their attempts to incorporate technology into journalism have been laughable at best (iPad apps! Paywalls! Social networking!). Their use of technology has only changed the way that old-journalism is consumed - they have made no attempts to use technology to change the process of journalism. A few old-media organizations have attempted to emulate WikiLeaks in their sourcing process, but they make none of the guarantees that WikiLeaks does about source anonymity, so they have not seen any success (as far as I am aware.)

Ativistas do projeto [Open Watch](http://openwatch.net) declararam o Wikileaks como _funcionalmente morto_. Mas não sem antes fazer uma [boa análise](http://openwatch.net/blog/18) do legado do projeto de Julian Assange. As empresas de comunicação tradicionais ainda não teriam conseguido usar as virtudes e fraquezas da web como meio de apuração. Nem mesmo inovar na produção de conteúdo. Estariam apenas tentando preencher lacunas de _consumo_ de informação, criando contas em redes sociais e produzindo aplicativos para iPad e celulares.
