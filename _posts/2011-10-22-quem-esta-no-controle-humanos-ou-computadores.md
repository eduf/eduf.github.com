> Computing is changing much faster than our ability to think about it. We are still stuck in a 1950s model of computation. (...)

We now live in a world where information is potentially unlimited. Information is cheap, but meaning is expensive. (...)

I am not sure whether computers are just tools. When you look at your iPhone to get directions, are you asking the phone where to go or is the phone telling you where to go? You cannot draw a strict line between active and passive information exchange. If some alien form of life came to earth, they might be convinced that there is a bodiless form of intelligence that is telling its constituent parts to turn left or right. So there is a symbiosis that works both ways.

Tem um monte de generalizações e coisas que precisariam de aprofundamento. Mas vale espiar.
