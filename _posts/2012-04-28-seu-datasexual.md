> The same cultural zeitgeist that gave us the metrosexual - the urban male obsessive about grooming and personal appearance - is also creating its digital equivalent: the datasexual. The datasexual looks a lot like you and me, but what’s different is their preoccupation with personal data. They are relentlessly digital, they obsessively record everything about their personal lives, and they think that data is sexy. In fact, the bigger the data, the sexier it becomes. Their lives - from a data perspective, at least - are perfectly groomed.

Segundo o "Digital Thinker, Electric Artists", [Dominic Basulto](http://www.dominicbasulto.com/), há uma nova tribo circulando pelas cidades, a dos [datasexuais](http://bigthink.com/endless-innovation/meet-the-urban-datasexual?utm_source=Big+Think+Weekly+Newsletter+Subscribers&utm_campaign=faf5516a06-Sat_4_28_There_s_No_Such_Thing_as_Disease4_27_2012&utm_medium=email). Basicamente, é formada por pessoas que guardam rastros digitais de todas as suas atividades. Pensou no Foursquare, Instragram, Facebook etc.?
