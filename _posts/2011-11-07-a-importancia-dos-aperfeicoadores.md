Em [artigo (um tanto prolixo) na New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/11/14/111114fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all), [Malcolm Gladwell](http://www.gladwell.com/) diz que a "genialidade" de Steve Jobs não estava exatamente em criar coisas, e sim de aperfeiçoá-las diligentemente:

> Jobs’s sensibility was editorial, not inventive. His gift lay in taking what was in front of him—the tablet with stylus—and ruthlessly refining it. (...)

_I’ll know it when I see it_. That was Jobs’s credo, and until he saw it his perfectionism kept him on edge. He looked at the title bars—the headers that run across the top of windows and documents—that his team of software developers had designed for the original Macintosh and decided he didn’t like them. He forced the developers to do another version, and then another, about twenty iterations in all, insisting on one tiny tweak after another, and when the developers protested that they had better things to do he shouted, “Can you imagine looking at that every day? It’s not just a little thing. It’s something we have to do right.”
De brinde, você leva a seguinte interpretação do que pode ser a filantropia:

> It’s true that Bill Gates is now more interested in trying to eradicate malaria than in overseeing the next iteration of Word. But this is not evidence of a lack of imagination. **Philanthropy on the scale that Gates practices it represents imagination at its grandest**. In contrast, Jobs’s vision, brilliant and perfect as it was, was narrow. He was a tweaker to the last, endlessly refining the same territory he had claimed as a young man.
