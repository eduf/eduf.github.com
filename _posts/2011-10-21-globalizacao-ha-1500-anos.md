> TODAY Peshawar in north-west Pakistan is a hotbed of insurgency and a strategic military entry point into Afghanistan. But more than 1,500 years ago the Gandhara region, which surrounded present-day Peshawar, was an important point along the Silk Road between China and the Mediterranean. Propelled by Alexander the Great’s conquest of the Persian Empire, settlers from the West brought classical Greco-Roman influences, while traders from the East brought Buddhism. This unique cross-pollination permeates art from the Gandhara region, which encompassed swaths of north-west Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan between the first century BC and the fifth century AD. These works are an extraordinary example of ancient globalisation.

Há 1500 anos, o noroeste do Pasquistão era palco de uma nova onda de globalização. Essa remixou a arte de inspiração grega com a desenvolvida por budistas. [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/10/buddhist-heritage-pakistan?fsrc=rss) fala sobre [uma exposição](http://asiasociety.org/arts/asia-society-museum/current-exhibitions/buddhist-heritage-pakistan-art-gandhara?page=1) que mostra fragmentos do que sobrou daquela época.
