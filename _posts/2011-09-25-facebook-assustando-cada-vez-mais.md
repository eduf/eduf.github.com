> Dave Winer wrote a timely piece this morning about how [Facebook is scaring him](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/24/facebookIsScaringMe.html) since the new API allows applications to post status items to your Facebook timeline without a users intervention. It is an extension of Facebook Instant and they call it frictionless sharing. The privacy concern here is that because you no longer have to explicitly opt-in to share an item, you may accidentally share a page or an event that you did not intend others to see.

The advice is to log out of Facebook. But logging out of Facebook only de-authorizes your browser from the web application, a number of cookies (including your account number) are still sent along to all requests to facebook.com. **Even if you are logged out, Facebook still knows and can track every page you visit.** The only solution is to delete every Facebook cookie in your browser, or to use a separate browser for Facebook interactions.
