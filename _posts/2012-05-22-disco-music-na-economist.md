[Artigo na Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2012/05/donna-summer-and-robin-gibb?fsrc=gn_ep) tenta atenuar a raiva contra a disco music:

> By the time that Donna Summer released “I Feel Love” in 1977, it was mainstream. Everyone was at it. Even the Rolling Stones released a lamentable disco attempt, “Hot Stuff”, in 1976. Nonetheless, “I Feel Love” was one of the most influential records of the decade. 

Até o Kiss fez [música influenciada pela disco](www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNGNLo8K6Fk). E, diz a lenda que, quando a gravadora pediu um hit disco para o AC/DC, a banda entregou "Jailbreak".
