> When anything irritates us, it's trying to communicate with us. Usually we are looking for an answer rather than trying to communicate with irritation. The point is to acknowledge irritation's presence rather than try to supress it.

Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, em [Work, Sex, Money: Real Life on the Path of MIndfulness](http://www.amazon.com/Work-Sex-Money-Real-Mindfulness/dp/1590305965), pages 212/213.
