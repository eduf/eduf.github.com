> We can’t keep designing as we used to if we want people to engage with our content. We can’t keep charging for ads that our layouts train readers to ignore. We can’t focus so much on technology that we forget the web is often, and quite gloriously, a transaction between reader and writer. 

O designer e dono da [Happy Cog](http://happycog.com/), [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/about/), lançou um [novo manifesto](http://www.zeldman.com/2012/05/18/web-design-manifesto-2012/). Vale conferir.
